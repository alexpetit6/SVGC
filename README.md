# SVGC
SVGC stands for Snoqualmie Valley Garden Club: the non-profit that this website is being made for. The goal is to have a plant themed website that is dynamically edited by admins of the club. An easy UX for the admin and a nice, clean, and snappy website for the visitor is paramount. It is currently a work in progress and will probably receive a lot of changes over time.
