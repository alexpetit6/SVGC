# SVGC
SVGC stands for Snoqualmie Valley Garden Club: the non-profit that this website was made for. It is a full-MERN stack app that gives admins a large amount of control over the content of the site. Admins have full CRUD over blog posts and events and can change the text content of every single page. The color theme of the site can also be changed with four different color variables and text will change from white to black depending on brightness of background color. Admins can also add, archive, and delete photos in the photo gallery.
